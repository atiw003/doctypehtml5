Hello {{ p.fullname }}!

Your registration for DocType HTML5 has been accepted. We look forward
to seeing you at the event on January 23.

The event will be hosted by the
[International Institute of Information Technology][IIIT], thanks to the
support of the Pascal Lab and the Business Incubation Unit. The website
has been updated with [directions to the venue][Venue].

You may want to add this to your calendar via [iCal][],
[Google Calendar][gCal], [Facebook][] or [LinkedIn][].

We are pleased to announce that [Microsoft][] continues to support DocType
HTML5 as the platinum sponsor. The new [Internet Explorer 9 beta][IE9]
brings HTML5 support to the world's most widely deployed browser. We think
you should check it out because this is the browser most of your users will
have available by default. With IE9, every major browser is now HTML5-ready,
so there's little reason to hold off switching to HTML5. This event will
help you get started.

### Staying updated ###

DocType HTML5 is a **free** event, but all participants must be registered
via the website. If you'd like to bring a friend along, please ask them to
[sign up][].

This is an event put together by volunteers as the foundation for a community
around HTML5. You can join the [discussion group][dg] to talk to fellow HTML5
enthusiasts. You can also help shape the event in several ways:

* Discuss the event on the [discussion group][dg]
* Tell us what you think [via Twitter][vtwit]
* Fork the source code for the website on [GitHub][]
* Reply to this email with your ideas

We greatly appreciate the attention you bring to the event by spreading the
word. To help us make the most of it,

* [Recommend the event][rec] to your followers on Twitter
* Use the Twitter hashtag ``#doctypehtml5``
* Tag your posts and photos with ``doctypehtml5``
* For future events, follow [HasGeek][] on [Twitter][ht] and [Facebook][hf].

### Updates ###

When registering, you were asked for your t-shirt size. The grand plan was
for a conference t-shirt for everyone who attended, but the bad news is that
t-shirts cost a lot more these days. There will be no free t-shirts unless
another sponsor steps up. At a past edition, a number of folks said they
would have been happy to pay for a t-shirt. We weren't expecting that, so
we're asking you upfront: would you buy a t-shirt? If yes, please reply to
this email with the first line "Yes, interested in buying a t-shirt". If
enough of you respond in time, we will make a t-shirt design and announce it
so that you can book yours.

The event's [agenda][] is under revision based on the reasons you submitted
when registering. Your continued feedback will help refine it. You can stay
updated on progress by following us on [Twitter][]. We will send you an email
update a day prior to the event.

Once again, thanks for registering, and see you on January 23!

Sincerely,

Kiran Jonnalagadda  
On behalf of the planning team
