Hello {{ p.fullname }}!

Your registration for DocType HTML5 has been accepted. We look forward
to seeing you at the event on November 27.

The event will be hosted by [IIT Madras][IITM]. The website has been
updated with [directions to the venue][Venue].

You may want to add this to your calendar via [iCal][],
[Google Calendar][gCal], [Facebook][] or [LinkedIn][].

We are pleased to announce that [Microsoft][], the platinum sponsor of the
first edition, have decided to support us as the platinum sponsor once again.
The new [Internet Explorer 9 beta][IE9] brings HTML5 support to the world's
most widely deployed browser. We think you should check it out because this
is the browser most of your users will have available by default. With IE9,
every one of the major browsers is now HTML5-ready, so there's little reason
to hold off on using it. This event will help you get started.

### Staying updated ###

DocType HTML5 is a **free** event, but all participants must be registered
via the website. If you'd like to bring a friend along, tell them to

This is an event put together by volunteers as the foundation for a community

enthusiasts. You can also help shape the event in several ways:

* Discuss the event on the [discussion group][dg]
* Tell us what you think [via Twitter][vtwit]

* [Recommend the event][rec] to your followers on Twitter
* Use the Twitter hashtag ``#doctypehtml5``
* Tag your posts and photos with ``doctypehtml5``

The event's [agenda][] is under revision based on the reasons you submitted
when registering. Your continued feedback will help refine it. You can stay
updated on progress by following us on [Twitter][]. We will send you an email
update a day prior to the event.

Once again, thanks for registering, and see you on October 9!

Sincerely,

Kiran Jonnalagadda
