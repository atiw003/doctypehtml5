Hello {{ p.fullname }}!

Your registration for DocType HTML5 has been accepted. We look forward
to seeing you at the event on December 4.

The event will be hosted by [College of Engineering, Pune][CoEP]. The
website has been updated with [directions to the venue][Venue].

You may want to add this to your calendar via [iCal][],
[Google Calendar][gCal], [Facebook][] or [LinkedIn][].

We are pleased to announce that [Microsoft][], the platinum sponsor of the
first edition, have decided to support us as the platinum sponsor once again.
The new [Internet Explorer 9 beta][IE9] brings HTML5 support to the world's
most widely deployed browser. We think you should check it out because this
is the browser most of your users will have available by default. With IE9,
every major browser is now HTML5-ready, so there's little reason not to use it.
This event will help you get started.

### Staying updated ###
